We use the Slack app, so this is what you'll have to use to communicate with the team.

Requirements to join CHAT:

None

Requirements if you WANT HELP with your builds:

- Have Linux installed.

- Compile and successfully flash your own ROM build first. 
    - Building CyanogenMod using CyanogenMod device trees and kernel source is the easiest,
      but we really don't care what you build.  We just want to know that your build environment
      is properly configured!
